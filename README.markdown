__DroneStitch iOS: stitching panoramas__  

Based on [OpenCVSwiftStitch](http://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch) 

This project was created to provide a way to stitch together drone-captured images into panoramas from iOS.

Using [DronePan](https://github.com/dbaldwin/DronePan) it's easy to capture 360 degree panoramas from your DJI drone, but stitching them together had to wait until you're near a Mac or PC.
